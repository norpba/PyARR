Implementation ideas:
- on macOS, the window can NOT be tiled with another app on a space (any desktop). ✅
- Path elements need to be changed into entry boxes. ✅
- Option menu for the user to choose with more sorting options.
  - more sorting option; implement a way to choose which file formats to exclude for example.
  - Sorting based on month and year, if the user chooses so.
  - 
- Some text graphics animation while the sorting process is running (maybe inside Logic-class for loop?).
- Show information about each widget on mouse hover. ✅
- Show size of all items inside source dir in megabytes / gigabytes

Optimization ideas:
- 'percentage_check' variable should work more consistently with the variable 'progress_percentage'
  - this could lead to even more of an optimized way to check in which part the sorter is on at a given moment
  - maybe give 'percentage_check' the value of 'progress_percentage' and then check if it has doubled or something like that
  
Research etc:
- research into installers and how to include dependencies in the installer.
