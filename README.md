# PyARR - Python Arranger - a simple python-based sorting tool
This is going to be my very first project that I'm going to work on. What I have in mind (for now, that is) is a file-sorter that takes in various filetypes (code, pictures, videos, and more) and organizes them into folders. These folders are created by the program and named based on a prompt from the user.

# Functionality:
1. User inputs files of a specific type into the program, for example image files.
2. User chooses a location for the base directory for their sorted files. For example "C:\Users\usernamehere\Pictures\PyARR_images".
3. User inputs a name for the directory. PyARR will add an identifier in the end of the sub.dir. name based on the creation year; ("Sorted images - 2022" for example).
4. The newly created and sorted directory could look something like this:

       Directory:
       - C:\Users\usernamehere\Pictures\PyARR images
           - Images 2021
               - image1.png
               - image2.png
           - Images 2022
               - image3.jpeg
           - Images 2023
               - image4.png
               - image5.jpeg
               - image6.webp
    
That's about it for now. I guess we'll see how far I go with this project as I will mostly work on it on the weekend.
